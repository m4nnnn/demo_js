# JavaScript Logic & DOM Manipulation Demo

This project is a practical exercise focused on mastering the fundamentals of **Vanilla JavaScript**. It demonstrates how to create interactive web elements by bridging the gap between HTML structure and dynamic behavior.

## Key Features

- **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically updating content and styles without reloading the page.
- **Event Handling:** Implementing listeners to respond to user actions (clicks, inputs).
- **Functional Logic:** Using JavaScript functions to process data and update the UI.

## Built with

- **HTML5** (Structural foundation)
- **CSS3** (Styling and transitions)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (Core logic and interactivity)

## What I learned from this project

### 1. The Power of Event Listeners
I learned how to select HTML elements using `querySelector` and attach `addEventListener` to trigger specific functions. This is the heart of any modern interactive website.

### 2. State Management
This project helped me understand how to store information in variables and update those values based on user interaction, then reflecting those changes in the DOM.

### 3. Separation of Concerns
I focused on keeping my JavaScript logic separated from my HTML and CSS, which is a crucial habit for building scalable applications.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/m4nnnn/demo_js.git](https://github.com/m4nnnn/demo_js.git)
   ```
2. Open index.html in your favorite browser.

3. Interact with the demo to see the JavaScript logic in action!
